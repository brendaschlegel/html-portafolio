<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Brenda Schlegel – Full Stack Developer
  I'm a passionate Full Stack Developer from Mexico, currently living in Germany. I love learning, exploring new places, 
  and embracing new experiences. I’m dedicated to expanding my skills in programming and the German language. Beyond coding, 
  I enjoy music, theater, action movies, and TV series. I believe in living life to the fullest, and my favorite color is black.</p>

<p>This website showcases my first HTML projects, marking the beginning of my journey as a developer. In the future, 
  I hope to fill it with many more and increasingly better projects. I love what I do, and I'm eager to grow, improve, 
  and stay up to date in my field. Every project here represents a step forward in my learning and development.</p>
